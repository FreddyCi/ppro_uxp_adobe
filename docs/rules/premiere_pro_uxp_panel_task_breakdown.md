Stores persist state across component re-renders, actions update state correctly, and TypeScript types prevent state mutation errors as required.
**Description:** Implement Zustand stores for application state management
**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `store/authStore.ts` - Authentication state (already implemented in T011)
- ✅ `store/generationStore.ts` - Image generation state with currentPrompt, generationHistory, isGenerating, selectedImage, progress tracking, session management, error handling, and comprehensive actions (setPrompt, updateSettings, startGeneration, addGeneration, selectImage, etc.)
- ✅ `store/galleryStore.ts` - Gallery and history state with images/correctedImages/videos collections, selection management, view modes (grid/list/details), sorting (newest/oldest/prompt/rating/size), filtering (tags/search/dateRange/typeFilter), pagination, bulk operations, and display item computation
- ✅ `store/uiStore.ts` - UI state including loading states with progress, toast notification system integration, navigation (activeTab), layout management (panelSize, sidebarCollapsed), modal system, theme management, user preferences, and global error handling
- ✅ Updated store/index.ts with comprehensive barrel exports including convenience hooks for each store
**Enhanced Store Features Implemented:**
- UXP-compatible localStorage persistence with selective state storage and rehydration logic
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces with proper type safety and prevention of state mutation errors
- Convenience hooks for specific state slices (useCurrentPrompt, useGallerySelection, useUIToasts, etc.)
- Helper hooks for common operations (useToastHelpers with showSuccess/showError/showInfo/showWarning)
- Session management with UUID generation and proper cleanup
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Error handling with timestamps and user-friendly messages
- Auto-cleanup features (toast auto-dismiss, history limits, selection validation)
- Consistent store patterns following authStore.ts architecture
**Store Structure Example (GenerationStore):**
```typescript
interface GenerationStore {
  currentPrompt: string;
  generationHistory: GenerationResult[];
  isGenerating: boolean;
  selectedImage: GenerationResult | null;
  actions: {
    setPrompt: (prompt: string) => void;
    addGeneration: (result: GenerationResult) => void;
    selectImage: (id: string) => void;
  }
}
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Stores persist state across component re-renders (localStorage persistence with rehydration)
- ✅ Actions update state correctly (comprehensive action implementations with proper state updates)
- ✅ TypeScript types prevent state mutation errors (strict typing with proper interfaces)
- ✅ Build passes without TypeScript errors (validated with pnpm build and pnpm type-check)
- ✅ All stores integrate with existing authentication and service systems
- ✅ Consistent patterns across all stores with proper error handling and loading states

**Coding Rules:**
- Review docs directory if needed
- Do not over engineer

### T023.6: Integrate Gallery with Azure Storage Upload
**Status:** To Do
**Dependencies:** T023.5
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimate:** 60 minutes
**Progress Note:** Gallery currently stores images in localStorage + memory blob URLs, not actual Azure Storage. Need to replace memory-based upload with real Azure SDK upload functionality.
**Description:** Replace Gallery's memory-based image storage with actual Azure Blob Storage uploads
**Deliverables:**
- Update Gallery.tsx upload functionality to use AzureSDKBlobService
- Replace memory blob URLs with Azure blob URLs from SAS tokens
- Implement proper Azure persistence so images survive browser refresh
- Add Azure blob URL generation for proper image serving
- Update Gallery store to track Azure blob metadata instead of data URLs
**Current Issue Analysis:**
- Gallery shows "Azure Storage ready" but only stores images in localStorage as data URLs
- Memory blob URLs (URL.createObjectURL) are session-only and not persistent
- No actual Azure upload occurs during image generation or upload workflows
- Images appear to persist due to localStorage but aren't in cloud storage
**Integration Changes:**
```typescript
// Replace current memory-based approach:
const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob); // Session-only
localStorage.setItem('gallery', JSON.stringify(images)); // Local only

// With Azure Storage integration:
const azureBlob = await azureBlobService.uploadBlob(file, 'uxp-images', blobName);
const sasUrl = await azureBlobService.generateBlobSASUrl('uxp-images', blobName, permissions, 3600);
// Store SAS URL for persistent access across sessions
```
**Technical Implementation:**
- **Replace Upload Functions:** Update Gallery upload handlers to call AzureSDKBlobService.uploadBlob()
- **SAS URL Management:** Generate time-limited SAS URLs for secure blob access in Gallery display
- **Blob URL Refresh:** Implement SAS token refresh when URLs expire (currently placeholder)
- **Metadata Storage:** Store Azure blob metadata (container, blob name, SAS URL) in Gallery store
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback to localStorage if Azure unavailable
- **Progress Tracking:** Show upload progress for Azure blob operations
**Updated Gallery Store Schema:**
```typescript
interface GalleryImage {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  blobUrl: string; // Azure SAS URL instead of memory blob URL
  azureMetadata?: {
    containerName: string;
    blobName: string;
    sasUrl: string;
    expiresAt: Date;
  };
  // Remove dataUrl field - no longer needed
}
```
**Environment Considerations:**
- **Development Mode:** Use memory blobs + localStorage for local testing
- **Production Mode:** Use Azure Storage with real blob uploads and SAS URLs
- **Hybrid Support:** Detect Azure availability and fallback gracefully
- **Cost Management:** Monitor blob storage usage and implement cleanup policies
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Gallery uploads actually create blobs in Azure Storage Account
- Images persist across browser restarts using Azure blob URLs, not localStorage
- SAS token refresh works when URLs expire (replace current placeholder)
- Upload progress shows Azure blob operation status
- Gallery store tracks Azure metadata instead of data URLs
- Environment switching works between local/Azure modes
- Error handling provides clear feedback for Azure failures
- Performance acceptable for UXP panel usage patterns

**Coding Rules:**
- Use existing AzureSDKBlobService - do not recreate Azure integration
- Replace memory blob usage in Gallery.tsx upload functions
- Update Gallery store to track Azure metadata instead of data URLs
- Implement SAS token refresh for expired blob URLs
- Follow established error handling patterns from other services
- Do not over engineer - focus on core upload to Azure functionality

  subscribeToGeneration(request: FalVideoRequest, onUpdate: (progress: GenerationProgress) => void): Promise<FalVideoResponse>

  // Image URL preparation (upload to temporary storage for API access)
  prepareImageUrls(startImage: File, endImage: File): Promise<{ start_image_url: string; end_image_url: string }>

  // Video download and storage
  downloadAndStoreVideo(videoUrl: string, metadata: VideoMetadata): Promise<StoredVideo>
}
```

**Enhanced Video Features:**
- **Smart Prompting:** Auto-generate motion descriptions based on image analysis
- **Quality Presets:** Web preview (480p, 16fps), HD export (720p, 24fps), quick draft (480p, 81 frames)
- **Batch Generation:** Queue multiple video requests with different settings
- **Motion Analysis:** Detect optimal motion paths between first/last frames
- **Content Safety:** Automatic content filtering with bypass options for professional use
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- FAL.ai API integration successfully generates videos from first/last frame images
- UI allows intuitive selection of start/end images from existing Gallery
- Video generation progress tracked in real-time with clear user feedback
- Generated videos download and store properly with full metadata preservation
- Quality controls (resolution, FPS, frame count) produce expected output variations
- Error handling manages API failures, timeouts, and safety checker rejections gracefully
- Generated videos play correctly and maintain acceptable quality for Premiere Pro import

**Coding Rules:**
- Review FAL-ai-reference.md documentation thoroughly before implementation
- Use FAL.ai's official JavaScript client (@fal-ai/client) for proper API integration
- Implement async/await patterns with proper error boundaries
- Follow established service patterns from FireflyService and GeminiService
- Do not over engineer - focus on core first-last-frame video generation workflow
