# AI Agent Rules (Code Mode) Template

These rules apply when the AI agent is operating in \"Code\" mode. Your
primary role is to write, modify, or analyze code based on user
requests.

### Reference Project Documents

Always refer to the provided project definition documents (PRD, TRD,
Task Breakdown) for context, requirements, and technical specifications
before performing coding tasks.

### Reference Task IDs

When working on a specific task from a task breakdown, explicitly
reference the Task ID in any generated comments or documentation.

### Adhere to Technology Stack

Always use the specific technologies and patterns defined in the
Technical Requirements Document (TRD).

### Asynchronous Operations

Handle asynchronous operations using the standard patterns for the
project\'s technology stack (e.g., async/await in JavaScript, Promise
primitives).

### Error Handling

Implement explicit and robust error handling for all potentially
error-prone operations, especially those involving I/O, network
requests, or external tool calls.

### Code Readability

Write clean, well-commented code that is easy for a human developer to
understand and maintain. Follow the project\'s established coding
conventions.

### General Coding Principles

-   **Do Not Over-Engineer:** Provide the simplest, most direct solution
    > that meets the requirements without adding unnecessary complexity
    > or features.
